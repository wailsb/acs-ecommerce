# Ecommerce Website Plan Using Django REST API

## 1. Define the Scope and Features

### Admin Account Features:
- Product management (add, update, delete products).
- Order management (view, update, and process orders).
- User management (view and manage client accounts).
- Inventory management (track stock levels).
- Sales analytics and reports.
- Discount and coupon management.

### Client Account Features:
- User registration and authentication.
- Product browsing and search.
- Add to cart and checkout functionality.
- Order history and tracking.
- Wishlist and saved items.
- Payment integration (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
- Reviews and ratings for products.

---

## 2. Database Design

Key tables:
- **Users**: Store client and admin account details.
- **Products**: Store product details (name, description, price, stock, category, etc.).
- **Orders**: Store order details (user, products, total price, status, etc.).
- **Cart**: Store items added to the cart by users.
- **Categories**: Organize products into categories (e.g., phones, airpods, smartwatches).
- **Reviews**: Store product reviews and ratings.
- **Discounts/Coupons**: Store discount codes and their details.

---

## 3. Backend Development with Django REST Framework (DRF)

### Set Up Django Project:
- Create a Django project and app for the ecommerce site.
- Install necessary packages (`djangorestframework`, `django-cors-headers`, `django-filter`, etc.).

### API Endpoints:
- **Authentication**: `/api/auth/register/`, `/api/auth/login/`, `/api/auth/logout/`.
- **Products**: `/api/products/`, `/api/products/<id>/`.
- **Cart**: `/api/cart/`, `/api/cart/<id>/`.
- **Orders**: `/api/orders/`, `/api/orders/<id>/`.
- **Reviews**: `/api/reviews/`, `/api/reviews/<id>/`.
- **Categories**: `/api/categories/`, `/api/categories/<id>/`.
- **Discounts/Coupons**: `/api/discounts/`, `/api/discounts/<id>/`.

### Authentication and Permissions:
- Use token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) for secure API access.
- Implement role-based access control (admin vs. client).

### Pagination and Filtering:
- Add pagination for product listings.
- Allow filtering by category, price range, brand, etc.

---

## 4. Frontend Development

- Use a frontend framework like React, Vue.js, or Angular to build the user interface.

### Key Pages:
- Homepage (featured products, categories, etc.).
- Product listing page (with filters and sorting).
- Product detail page (description, reviews, add to cart).
- Cart and checkout page.
- User dashboard (order history, wishlist, account settings).
- Admin dashboard (manage products, orders, users, etc.).

---

## 5. Payment Integration

- Integrate a payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal for secure transactions.
- Create an API endpoint to handle payment processing (`/api/payment/`).
- Ensure compliance with PCI DSS standards for secure payment handling.

---

## 6. Testing

- Write unit tests for all API endpoints.
- Test the frontend for responsiveness and usability.
- Perform integration testing to ensure the frontend and backend work seamlessly.
- Test payment processing and order flow.

---

## 7. Deployment

### Backend:
- Use a cloud platform like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean.
- Set up a PostgreSQL database for production.
- Use Gunicorn and Nginx for serving the Django app.

### Frontend:
- Deploy the frontend using platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS S3.

### Domain and SSL:
- Purchase a domain and configure SSL for secure communication.

---

## 8. Post-Launch Maintenance

- Monitor site performance using tools like Google Analytics or Sentry.
- Regularly update product listings and inventory.
- Implement a backup strategy for the database.
- Continuously improve the site based on user feedback.

---

## 9. Security Considerations

- Use HTTPS for all communications.
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of API endpoints.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.

---

## 10. Scalability

- Use caching (e.g., Redis) to improve performance for frequently accessed data.
- Optimize database queries and use indexing.
- Consider using a CDN for serving static files and images.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, JWT for authentication.
- **Frontend**: React.js (or any modern frontend framework).
- **Payment Gateway**: Stripe or PayPal.
- **Deployment**: AWS/Heroku, Gunicorn, Nginx.
- **Monitoring**: Sentry, Google Analytics.
